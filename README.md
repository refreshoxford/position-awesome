position-awesome
================

Chrome extension to move absolutely positioned elements in order to quicken prototyping.

# Change of action
This will now look to being a Chrome Developer Tools Extension, since we want to deal with the inspector directly.

## Actions
- Select element in Chrome inspector
- Click **position-awesome** extension button
- Drag element to new position (this is where things get confusing...)

## Todo
- Copy [refreshoxford/tldw](http://github.com/refreshoxford/tldw) Chrome extension and strip for a template
- Find "inspector selected element" target
- Find "set inline style" method
